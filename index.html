          <h2>Data Collection</h2>
          <p>Just about everything we do online can be tracked using data. Not everyone's online habits are the same, however, so the datafication of our online practices can produce different results. Personally, I spend a lot of time online shopping. For my data collection project, I turned my online shopping habits into a set of data.</p>
          <p>My online shopping habits have always interested me because of the different ways I go about using different apps. Sometimes when I need something specific, I search for it and buy it right away. I even online shopping as a form of entertainment when I am bored or procrastinating. When I find something I really want, I try to find a coupon code. If I don't get a discount, I might not buy it. If I am getting a really good deal, I am more inclined to buy the item(s). For my data collection project, I turned these habits into categories to track how they effect whether or not I buy item(s).</p>
          <p>Tracking the way I online shop enabled me to deeply analyze how I do it. For instance, I used ordinal scales to measure how much I desired or needed the item(s) that I was shopping for. Normally, I am not so thorough while i online shop. Because I created these data points, I was able to shop efficiently as well as save money on the things I did not need. Thus, by turning my online shopping habits into a set of data, I learned how to engage in efficient and cost-effective online shopping.</p>

          <h2>Data Visualisation</h2>
          <p> Simplicity with data can make all the difference in telling a visual story. So, for my data visualisation project I wanted to create a visual that is both simple and appealing to the eye. <a href="http://www.dear-data.com/theproject/">The Dear Data Project</a> had several floral patterns that were not only aesthetically pleasing, but also allowed for the possibility to include different categories depending on the number of petals, leafs, size, etc. Feeling inspired, I decided to use a floral theme for my data visualisation. I used the highlighted data in the Data Collection chart above as the data points for my visualisation.</p>
          <p> After exploring Inkscape on my own for a while, I figured out how to change the "spoke ratio" and "rounded" elements of the star tool. The duplicate tool was vital to the efficiency of my project. I also discovered the paint bucket tool, which allowed me to not only change the color of a petal or flower, but also create a new petal or flower that was the exact same shape and size as the original color. I have never been good at drawing or graphic design so I am glad that this project allowed me to expand my abilities to include using a tool like Inkscape to create an image that visualizes my own personal set of data. </p>

          <h2>Explained Video</h2>
          <p>Researching Uber's plans to use data technology in an attempt to help drivers dealing with drunk passengers showed me how dangerous the process of datafication can be. As mentioned in the video, companies creating "paper humans" just to save money or avoid liability might not only be counterintuitive, but unethical. Though data collection can be an efficient way to learn about how people engage online, there are certain lines that shouldn't be crossed. Uber's intent to turn users' fun nights out into a set of "drunk data" is both unethical and dangerous.</p>
          <p>Before taking this class, I had basically no previous video editing experience. The explained video project really allowed me to explore and utilize the basic elements of iMovie. Editing the video was both a challenge and a learning process. In the end, my group put together a video that is not only organized, but visually makes sense with what is being talked about in the video itself.</p>

          <h2>Summing Up</h2>
          <p>In each major project this semester, I have learned about both the benefits and risks involved in data collection. Collecting data about my online shopping habits not only enabled me to find patterns through data, but also find an efficient and cost-effective way to online shop. In my data visualisation, I was able to create both a simple and attractive image that presented the data points I collected for my online shopping habits. However, I also learned that data collection can often be used for unethical practices. Researching for the explained video project taught me a valuable lesson that data collection is not always a beneficial tool for every party involved. Because just about everything we do online can be tracked with data, these projects have allowed me to easily identify when datafication is being used in an ethical and beneficial way or not.<p>
